       description: "Maple Hill is one of my favorite places in the world. With its stunning scenery, exceptional course design, and top-notch maintenance, it's a must-visit for any disc golfer. I've had the pleasure of competing here and camping on-site, which only added to the experience. I might be a bit biased, too, since I was nominated for Shot of the Year for a memorable throw on Hole 13!",

       description: "This is the toughest course I've ever tackled. If you show up without your A game, it will definitely make you pay. I competed on this course during the 2019 World Championships, and scoring close to par was considered a solid performance. In the fast-paced world of disc golf, that's quite rare. With its long, wooded fairways, this course demands precise shot placement and strategic landing zones. Any errant throws can lead to disastrous scores. If you're up for a serious challenge, this is the course to test your skills.",

Owned by Paul McBeth and his team, this course is a must-play for anyone visiting Florida.
